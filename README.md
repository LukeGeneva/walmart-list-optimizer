# Walmart List Optimizer

This project is a Chrome extension that is meant to run on the Walmart website.
When a store is selected, it runs on item pages and extracts the aisle that the
item is located in. If it finds the aisle, it renders a button alongside "Add to
cart" that says "Add to List." Upon clicking this button, the item is added to a
list for you that is sorted by location.

For people who like doing their shopping themselves, it streamlines the trip to
the store by allowing you to get all of the things on the list in one pass.
